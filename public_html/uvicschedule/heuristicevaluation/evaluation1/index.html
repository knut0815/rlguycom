        <h1>Heuristic Evaluation #1</h1>

        <h2>1. Application Description</h2>

        <p>UVicSchedule application is being evaluated in this heuristic evaluation. The 
        application is used to organize your course schedule. You are able to add and drop 
        courses on your schedule.  Also, you can share your schedule with your friends and 
        see their schedules as well.</p>

        <h2>2. Nielsen's heuristics and descriptions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><b> Visibility of system status</b><br>
            The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, 
            through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.
            </li><br>
            <li><b> Match between system and real world (Speak the user's language) </b><br>
            Speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the 
            user. Follow real-world conventions, and natural / logical order. 
            </li><br>
            <li><b>User control and freedom (Clearly marked exits) </b><br>
            Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly
            marked and quick “emergency exit”. Support undo and redo, a clear way to 
            navigate.
            </li><br>
            <li><b>Consistency and standards</b><br>
            Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or 
            actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions. 
            </li><br>
            <li><b>Help users recognize, diagnose, recover from errors</b><br>
            Error messages should be expressed in plain language, precisely indicate the 
            problem, and suggest a solution. 
            </li><br>
            <li><b>Error prevention</b><br>
            Even better than good error messages is a careful design, which prevents a 
            problem from occurring in the first place.
            </li><br>
            <li><b> Recognition rather than recall</b><br>
            Minimize the user's memory load. Make objects, actions, options, and 
            instructions visible.
            </li><br>
            <li><b>Flexibility and efficiency of use</b><br>
            Accelerators — unseen by the novice — may speed up interaction for the 
            expert. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
            </li><br>
            <li><b>Aesthetic and minimalist design </b><br>
            Dialogues should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. 
            Visual layout principles: contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. 
            </li><br>
            <li><b>Help and documentation</b><br>
            Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it 
            may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information 
            should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be 
            carried out, and not be too large.
            </li><br>
        </ol>

        <h3>Nielsen's Scale:</h3>

        <p>
        0 = I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all.<br>
        1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on      
        project.<br>
        2 = Minor usability problem:  fixing this should be given low priority.<br>
        3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority.<br>
        4 = Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be released.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Findings</h2>

        <h3>3.1 [Recognition][Severity 3]</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                When you try to add a new course, you cannot see the 
                schedule clearly. You miss some days.
            </li>
            <li>
                This is a major usability problem. I need to see the 
                schedule clearly so I can see if the course fits my 
                schedule.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the bar on the left appears, the size of the 
                schedule should get smaller. Therefore, the user 
                would be able to see entire schedule.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.2 [Recognition][Severity 2]</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                It is hard to see the time bar
            </li>
            <li>
                This is a minor usability problem. It doesn’t affect the 
                user but if someone who has vision problems would 
                have a hard time to recognize.
            </li>
            <li>
                The time bar would be bigger so users would see it 
                easily.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.3 [Recognition][Severity 2]</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Abbreviations of the courses are not clear. Users have 
                to know the abbreviations.
            </li>
            <li>
                This is a minor usability problem. When you click on 
                the courses, in the description it is not shown what 
                the abbreviation stands for.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the description the full name of the course should 
                be written so the user would know what the 
                abbreviation stands for.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.4 [Error prevention][Severity 3]</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Logout button wouldn't be next to the other buttons 
                because it is easy to hit the button mistakenly when 
                you try to navigate other screens. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The user would navigate the login screen so he has to 
                login again. That is waste of time so this is a major 
                usability problem
            </li>
            <li>
                The button would be on the right so it would be hard 
                to make a mistake
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Summary</h2>

        <p>Even though there are a few major and minor usability problems,
        the application is still usable and efficient. The user would use the 
        application easily and wouldn’t have a hard time to figure out how the 
        application runs. </p>
