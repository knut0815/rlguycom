  <h1>UvicSchedule - Formal Proposal and Prototyping</h1>
  <b>UvicSchedule Application</b><br>
  <b>Team:</b> Dragon Squad<br>
  <b>Team Members:</b> Kevin D., Ryan G., Ian S.<br>
  
  <h2>Proposal</h2>
  
  <p>The UVicSchedule application will provide an easy and intuitive way for a user 
  to create and maintain their course schedule, view their schedule offline, and 
  compare their schedule with friends.</p>
  
  <h3>Current Problem</h3>
  
  <p>The UVic web interface for course scheduling (and in general) is atrocious. 
  The interface is archaic and unintuitive, with poor support for common browser features 
  like tabs and the back button. The experience is even worse on mobile, with tiny, 
  cluttered buttons and no support for sideways scrolling or zooming, making certain features 
  impossible to use. Almost everyone who uses the system either prints out a copy of their weekly 
  schedule or keeps some kind of offline copy on their phone in order to avoid using the 
  UVic website. Many users report that it takes a week or more to schedule courses 
  through the UVic system, noting that the only positive thing to be said about it 
  is that it is better than lining up at the registrar's office.</p>
  
  <h3>How Will UVicSchedule Fix That?</h3>
  
  <p>The UVicSchedule app will provide an offline schedule as well as an improved course 
  searching interface so that people can track their schedule without a headache, and sign 
  up for the courses that they want without hassle. Not only will it have a cleaner searching 
  interface, it will include options to exclude courses that conflict with your current schedule 
  so that building a schedule is easy. It will include sharing features so that saving or printing 
  your schedule is easy, and sending your schedule to friends is convenient. Through interviews, 
  it was found that many users copy their schedule to Google Calendar, so convenient exporting 
  functionality will be included as a feature. If you need to compare your schedule with your 
  friends, you can overlay multiple schedules by simply selecting your multiple saved schedules 
  and instantly see when you and your friends each have a break.</p>
  
  <h3>Required Tech</h3>
  
  <p>The UVicSchedule app will need to interface with the UVic course database somehow, 
  either by scraping, or with UVic's permission. </p>
  
  <h2>Conceptual Design</h2>
  
  <p>An affinity diagram was created as a conceptual model in order to map out the 
  hypothetical functionality of the UVicSchedule application. The diagram was designed 
  around three user tasks.</p>
  
  <h3>User Tasks</h3>
  
  <p>The following scenarios were chosen because the primary features of the app are 
  searching for and adding courses, comparing timetables to friends, and making it 
  easy for the user to track their UVic schedule. These three scenarios will give a good 
  idea of the breadth of functions provided by the UVicSchedule app.</p>

  individual paper prototypes of the application.</p>

  <div align="center"><i>Figure 1 The Final Affinity Diagram</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h2>Individual Prototypes</h2>
  
  <p>Three paper prototypes were completed individually in complete isolation from 
  one another in order to maintain a flow of free, unfiltered, and exclusive thought. 
  Starting with a common ancestor, the affinity diagram, each prototype branched off 
  in its own unique evolutionary path. A path guided and limited only by the logic and 
  fantasy of its creator's own supple mind.</p>
  
  <h3>Prototype #1 (Created by Ryan G.)</h3>
  
  <p><i>"For my paper prototype, I decided to lay out the views of the application in a 
  landscape format. I knew right from the start that conveying an entire week of scheduled 
  classes would require a large amount of screen real estate. I know from personal experience 
  that a lot can happen in a week, and I am not willing to limit my schedule to the 
  narrow confines of a portrait format. With a landscape format, the timetable and 
  menus can be viewed alongside one another (visibility). Menus can be pulled out from the 
  left and right by swiping in those directions respectively (mapping). Serious actions such
  as adding or deleting courses display confirmations that the action has successfully completed
  (feedback)."</i> - Ryan G.</p>

  <h3>Prototype #2 (Created by Ian S.)</h3>
  
  <p><i>"Visibility. This design does the best that it can to make the schedule visible 
  while still making the functions of each page accessible. Wherever there is a page that 
  swipes in from the side I make sure to indicate where and how the user can swipe with a 
  small arrow.<br><br>
  
  Feedback. I tried to incorporate feedback in the course addition menu, when you have 
  selected a course to add it shows you where the various blocks fit on your schedule 
  and allows you to pick which block and lab you want accordingly.<br><br>
  
  Constraints. I limit the possible interactions by using slide in windows that only 
  allow the currently available actions to be visible at any given moment.<br><br>
  
  Mapping. I use established conventions of the iOS environment when designing the 
  various menus, controls and lists in my design. The method of swiping a list item 
  to the left to show its delete button is a common feature of iOS. The buttons that 
  I use for the share menu and course list are buttons that are common in iOS apps, 
  so that if the user is already familiar with the UI of their iPhone, they will be 
  familiar with this app.<br><br>
  
  Consistency. The arrows on the edge of the screen always indicate a swipe and indicate 
  the direction of that swipe. The schedule list and share button follow established iOS 
  functionality, and clicking on a course's name always leads to that course's description page.<br><br>
  
  Affordance. The lists provide scrolling, as expected of lists, the arrows provide swiping, 
  and everything that looks like a button can be pressed, from menu icons to course blocks to 
  list entries." </i> - Ian S.</p>

  <div align="center"><i>Figure 8 Original Prototype by Ian S.</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h3>Prototype #3 (Created by Kevin D.)</h3>
  
  <h4>Login Screen</h4>
  
  <p>This is the first page the user is presented with, featuring a prominent logo, 
  and two clearly labelled text fields.</p>
  
  <p>The design makes the assumption that the user is familiar with pressing enter on their 
  phone keyboard to submit a form. This practice is quite common, even on phones.</p>
  
  <div align="center"><img src="images/image09.jpg"></i></div>
  <div align="center"><i>Figure 9 Login Screen</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h4>Overall Design Choices</h4>
  
  <p>Because of the small target screen size, this design makes use of icons for many functions. 
  Effort was taken to choose very recognizable symbols. Buttons are labelled when icons would
  not be appropriate. Because English literacy is required for enrollment at UVic, there is 
  no need for additional language support.</p>
  
  <p>Interface elements are generally rounded in appearance, to give a smooth, relaxed look 
  to the application. The design would make use of the UVic website's deep blue colour 
  in the header and any bottom action bars, and otherwise favour a relatively colour-neutral design, 
  for accessibility reasons. Additionally, drop shadows would be employed to denote the hierarchy 
  of elements, with important elements such as the header bar casting a shadow on the views beneath.</p>
  
  <p>To reduce clutter, whenever an interface element appears over the rest of the interface, 
  as with the Course Detail View, the rest of the app is darkened. This makes it clear 
  that the user should be acting upon the displayed element.</p>
  
  <div align="center"><img src="images/image10.jpg"></i></div>
  <div align="center"><i>Figure 10 Schedule View</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h4>Header Bar</h4>
  
  <p>With the exception of the login screen, the app is clearly split into three distinct pages, 
  denoted by the three icon tabs up top: an eye for viewing the schedule, a magnifying glass 
  for course searching, and two silhouettes for sharing. Additionally, there is a gear icon 
  on the right, which brings up a standard list of settings, using the style of whichever OS 
  the app is installed on. A tabbed format allows the user to quickly switch between important 
  tasks without navigating a hierarchical view.</p>
  
  <h4>Schedule</h4>
  
  <p>This screen presents a weekly timetable for the user, and is the default page of the app. 
  Courses can be tapped to bring up a small details dialogue. The dropdown menu at
  the top brings up the schedule selector, and the floppy disc icon in the bottom right 
  can be used to save a picture of the schedule.</p>
  
  <p>Clear labelling of courses, dates, and times should quickly make it obvious 
  that this is a schedule.</p>
  
  <p>In retrospect, this design lacks a means of changing the time being viewed. Because 
  some courses last for only part of a term, and the user might wish to view upcoming 
  or previous terms, this is a crucial oversight.</p>
  
  <h4>Schedule: Schedule Selector</h4>
  
  <p>This menu is accessed from the Schedule Screen. It presents a checklist of names, for 
  the people who have shared their schedules with the user. Any number may be selected, 
  and when the view is dismissed (either by pressing the top segment of the dropdown, or 
  by pressing outside of the menu), the user will be shown the Multiple Schedule View.</p>
  
  <p>While most users should be familiar with the notion of a dropdown menu, it is not 
  common for a dropdown to also be a checklist. This is very functional, but may not be
  entirely clear, and would benefit from an "OK" or "Select" button to confirm and 
  dismiss the dialog.</p>
  
  <div align="center"><img src="images/image11.jpg"></i></div>
  <div align="center"><i>Figure 11 Schedule Selector</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h4>Schedule: Multiple Schedules</h4>
  
  <p>This is a mode of the Schedule View, for when the user has multiple schedules selected. 
  Schedules appear overlapped, and are colour coded by person, with a legend at the
  bottom of the screen.</p>
  
  <p>To prevent clutter, course names are not shown while in this mode. However, courses 
  may still be pressed to view details. This mode would benefit from an additional
  dialogue which appears when the user could have pressed one of several courses, 
  to let them specify which course to view. It would be a simple list of items, from which 
  the user would select one.</p>
  
  <div align="center"><img src="images/image12.jpg"></i></div>
  <div align="center"><i>Figure 12 Multiple Schedule View</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h4>Schedule: Course Detail View</h4>
  
  <p>This dialog appears when a course is pressed in the Schedule Screen. It contains 
  the kind of information that a user might want to know when trying to find the class, or
  when confirming the start or end time.</p>
  
  <p>It is dismissed with the done button, or by pressing outside of the dialog.</p>
  
  <div align="center"><img src="images/image13.jpg"></i></div>
  <div align="center"><i>Figure 13 Course Detail View</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h4>Course Search</h4>
  
  <p>This page is used to find courses, based on a set of criteria. At the top, 
  the user can select which term they are searching, and specify the fields of study, 
  and course levels, using a dropdown checklist like the Schedule Selector. Additionally, 
  the user may choose to view only courses for which they are eligible.</p>
  
  <p>A drop shadow would be cast from the filter options over the search results, to 
  clearly distinguish the two elements.</p>
  
  <p>Search results are displayed in a list, with the option to view scheduled times, 
  and further information about the course. These are divided into clear blocks. Ideally, 
  these blocks would take up slightly less than all of the screen, such that the next 
  item is obscured. This would make it very obvious that the list is scrollable.</p>
  
  <div align="center"><img src="images/image14.jpg"></i></div>
  <div align="center"><i>Figure 14 Course Search</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h4>Course Search: Times/Info</h4>
  
  <p>When the user presses the "Times" button of one of the course search results, this element 
  appears below the course, pushing down the rest of the list.</p>
  
  <p>This is another list, but will scroll with the rest of the search results. The user 
  can press the "View" button to see what their schedule would look like with this course
  added, and can press "Sign Up" to enrol.</p>
  
  <p>The "Time" and "Info" buttons are treated like tabs, in that only one may be open 
  at a time. However, they are closed when their button is pressed again, or if 
  their respective course is pressed. This is to prevent excessive lengthening of the list.</p>
  
  <p>To keep the interface hierarchy clear, the "Times" and "Info" tabs should not be 
  made to appear on top of their respective course. This is again accomplished by having the
  course cast a shadow on them.</p>
  
  <p>Pressing "Info" brings up the same type of element, which contains only details 
  about the course.</p>
  
  <div align="center"><img src="images/image15.jpg"></i></div>
  <div align="center"><i>Figure 15 Course Search Times/Info</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h4>Schedule: Course Preview</h4>
  
  <p>This is another mode of the Schedule view, which is accessed when pressing "View" 
  from the "Times" dialog of a search item. It shows the user's schedule as it would be
  if the selected course were added.</p>
  
  <p>The new course is shown in a different colour, to clearly distinguish it from the 
  others, and the bar at the top states that the user is viewing tentative schedule.</p>
  
  <p>At the bottom, three buttons appear: "Clear", which returns to a normal Schedule 
  view; "Back", which returns to the search results; and "Sign Up", which signs up for the
  course, as in the previous view.</p>
  
  <div align="center"><img src="images/image16.jpg"></i></div>
  <div align="center"><i>Figure 16 Course Schedule Preview</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h4>Sharing</h4>
  
  <p>Here, the user can manage whom they share their schedule with. The dialog at the 
  top is used for sharing with others. This requires entering their Netlink ID, and a
  name for the app to refer to the person.</p>
  
  <p>Below is a list of people that the user has shared their schedule with, displaying 
  their name, Netlink ID, and the relationship between the users. If both users have shared
  with one another, it reads "Mutual". If the other user has not reciprocated, it reads 
  "Has not shared". Vice versa, it reads "Is sharing". In this case, the "Unshare" button
  reads "Remove".</p>
  
  <p>The "Unshare" button accompanying each other user makes the user's schedule unviewable 
  by the other. The user will also no longer be able to view the other's schedule.</p>
  
  <p>The social aspect of the app is very simple, so this interface is meant to be 
  quick to use. To minimise hassle, the sharing mechanism is asymmetric. This means 
  that a user can their schedule with a friend, and it will immediately be viewable .</p>
  
  <div align="center"><img src="images/image17.jpg"></i></div>
  <div align="center"><i>Figure 17 Sharing</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h2>Final Group Prototype</h2>
  
  <p>After a tough and brutal session of isolated design, each member of team Dragon Squad 
  presented their prototypes, ideas, and dreams to each other in a non-threatening democratic 
  environment. Countless hours of debate, constructive criticism, and iteration resulted 
  in the ultimate prototype. A prototype worthy of the name 'Dragon Squad'.</p>
  
  <h3>Application Layout</h3>
  
  <p>The UVicSchedule application consists of six views:</p>
  
  <h4>1. Login</h4>
  
  <p>This view displays the initial login screen. The user must login to the application in order to 
  pull their course information from UVic. The user uses their Netlink ID and password as credentials.</p>
  
  <div align="center"><a href="images/image18-big.jpg"><img src="images/image18.jpg"></a></i></div>
  <div align="center"><i>Figure 18 Login View</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h4>2. Main View</h4>
  
  <p>This view displays the user's timetable in a large format. The settings, courses, 
  schedules, and export menus may be accessed from the top toolbar.</p>
  
  <div align="center"><a href="images/image19-big.jpg"><img src="images/image19.jpg"></a></i></div>
  <div align="center"><i>Figure 19 Main View</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h4>3. Course View</h4>
  
  <p>This view displays the user's courses in a list alongside their timetable. The user 
  is able to hide courses, manage waitlisted courses, and add new courses. From this menu, 
  the user can access the course search menu.</p>
  
  <div align="center"><a href="images/image20-big.jpg"><img src="images/image20.jpg"></a></i></div>
  <div align="center"><i>Figure 20 Course Menu View</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h4>4. Course Search View</h4>
  
  <p>This views displays a real-time search menu alongside the user's timetable. The user 
  can specify search criteria through a search setting menu. Courses matching the user's 
  query are displayed in a list. Each course expands to show each lecture, tutorial, 
  and lab section. The user is able to select sections and view what those sections would 
  look like on their timetable.</p>
  
  <div align="center"><a href="images/image21-big.jpg"><img src="images/image21.jpg"></a></i></div>
  <div align="center"><i>Figure 21 Course Search View</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h4>5. Detailed Course View</h4>
  
  <p>This view displays detailed information about a course. This view is accessed when a 
  user taps a course in either a course list or on his or her schedule. The user is able to 
  add or drop the course from this view if one of those actions is relevant to the situation.</p>
  
  <div align="center"><a href="images/image22-big.jpg"><img src="images/image22.jpg"></a></i></div>
  <div align="center"><i>Figure 22 Detailed Course View</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h4>6. Schedule Sharing View</h4>
  
  <p>This view displays a list of contacts alongside the user's schedule. By selecting contacts, 
  the user is able to view a contact's timetable overlaid on top of his or her timetable 
  in order to compare schedules. The user is also able to manage their contacts from this menu.</p>

  <h2>Donald Norman's Principles of Design</h2>
  
  <p>Donald Norman introduced six core principles and concepts of design in his book "The Design 
  of Everyday Things". Visibility, feedback, constraints, mapping, consistency, and affordance 
  are crucial concepts for understanding usability and learnability in everyday objects. 
  As proud supporters of Donald Norman, Team Dragon Squad tries its best to adhere to his principles, 
  both publicly and privately.</p>
  
  <h3>1. Visibility</h3>
  
  <p>A landscape view was chosen in order to display menus and the user's timetable in the same
  screen. From any screen in the application, the user is able to see and access any menu. This
  provides visibility to the functions of the application.</p>
  
  <h3>2. Feedback</h3>
  
  <p>When a user performs an action in the app, you can sure bet that the user will see the results of
  that action shoved right in his or her face. When a user adds a course, they will see the timetable
  update in real time. In fact, the user will see any modifications to the timetable view in real time
  whether it be comparing schedules, hiding courses, or viewing alternate course sections.</p>
  
  <h3>3. Constraints</h3>
  
  <p>The user's interaction with other UVicSchedule app users is constrained to their contact list. The
  user is in charge of who they share their schedule with, and who gets to show up on their contact
  list.</p>
  
  <h3>4. Mapping</h3>
  
  <p>The concept of mapping is heavily used in the UVicSchedule app. Choice of icons were carefully
  selected in order to conform with Apple's iOS standards. This creates an intuitive mapping for users
  that are familiar with other iOS application.</p>
  
  <h3>5. Consistency</h3>
  
  <p>The schedule, courses, and course search view are consistent with each other. Each of the menus
  are displayed in the same orientation and size, are opened closed in the same way, and each is able
  to display real-time actions in the timetable view alongside the menu.</p>
  
  <h3>6. Affordance</h3>
  
  <p>The application uses buttons for when things should be tapped, lists for displaying details, plus
  symbol icons for adding elements, and textboxes for entering information. UI elements were
  chosen carefully to provide the actions that they afford.</p>
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  
  <p>Team Dragon Squad aims to help UVic students manage their day to day lives with their simple, 
  intuitive, and streamlined UVicSchedule application. Every second that a student spends creating 
  their course timetable is a precious second taken from their lives, never to be returned. A student 
  that can reduce the time spent creating a timetable is a student that is able to focus on grabbing 
  that next rung on the long ladder to success. And that is what Team Dragon Squad is truly about. 
  Because a child born into a world free of the tedious scheduling process is a child born into a 
  world where miracles are common place.</p>
