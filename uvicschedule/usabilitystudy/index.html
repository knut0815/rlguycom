  <h1>UvicSchedule Prototype Usability Study</h1>
  <b>UvicSchedule Application</b><br>
  <b>Team:</b> Dragon Squad<br>
  <b>Team Members:</b> Kevin D., Ryan G., Ian S.<br>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
  <p>UvicSchedule is a mobile application that hopes to improve Uvic’s MyPage course scheduling system. The
  application allows users to easily register for courses, share and compare their schedule with friend, and export
  their schedule to other applications such as Google Calendar and Facebook.</p>
  
  <p>A usability study of the prototype was conducted in order to communicate with the target audience and
  evaluate certain aspects of the application.</p>
  
  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  
  <p>The objectives of the usability study were to test whether students found the UvicSchedule application intuitive,
  easy to use, learnable, and if they had any suggestions on improving the user interface of the. Another objective
  of the study was to find out if the application’s method of course registration was preferred over the current
  Uvic MyPage scheduler.</p>
  
  <h2>Method</h2>
  
  <p>The UvicSchedule application was tested by using the method of natural observation. Study participants were
  observed individually as they completed tasks within the applications. The participants were timed while
  completing tasks and also a record of how many taps/clicks were performed while completing each task was
  measured. After the participant completed all tasks, they were asked a questionnaire on certain aspects of the
  application.</p>
  
  <h3>Participants</h3>
  
  <p>The usability study involved seven current Uvic students, either gender, aged 18-26 years old. The participants
  were expected to have past experience with mobile devices and course registration using MyPage.</p>
  
  <h3>Tasks</h3>
  
  <p>Each subject was asked to perform three tasks using the application prototype and one task within the MyPage
  system. In order to measure learnability, the participants were asked to perform the tasks again a week later.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Search and register for courses</li>
    <li>Compare schedule with a friend</li>
    <li>Export schedule to Google Calendar</li>
    <li>Search and register for courses using MyPage</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Procedure</h3>

  <h3>Measures</h3>
  
  <p>Study participants were asked to perform tasks within the application prototype and within MyPage. As the
  participants were completing the tasks, the time and number of clicks to complete each task were recorded. The
  user was kept ignorant of what measures were being recorded. These measurements were recorded again in a
  second session after about a week of time had passed. After the participant completed all tasks in the second
  session, a questionnaire was conducted and comments and suggestions were recorded.</p>
  
  <p>Time and number of clicks were also recorded when the application was used by an expert of the system in
  order to compare times and optimal number of clicks with a new user.</p>
  
  <h3>Setting and Equipment</h3>
  
  <p>The setting of the experiment was in a medium size, well lit room, seated at a table. A stopwatch was used to
  time the subject, and a notebook was used to make notes and keep track of taps/clicks through each task.</p>
  
  <h2>Results</h2>
  
  <p>The following tables contain the time and click data of each task recorded from the usability study</p>

  <h2>Discussion</h2>
  
  <p>From the quantitative data obtained from the usability study, it was found that registering for courses using the
  UvicSchedule prototype application was significantly faster than using the Uvic MyPage system, and also
  required less clicks to complete the task. Overall, the participants took less time and less clicks to add courses on
  the second attempt when adding courses using the UvicSchedule application prototype. Some participants
  commented that they preferred using the application to add courses over the current MyPage system.</p>
  
  <p>It was found that the application was easily learnable by the participants. On the second attempts, every user
  was able to improve their time and reach the optimum number of clicks when sharing their schedule and when
  exporting to google calendar.</p>
  
  <p>The participants of the study found the visual design of the prototype to be appealing. Participants found the
  application easy to use, simple, and intuitive.</p>
  
  <h3>Suggestions</h3>
  
  <p>Suggestions on how to improve the user interface were obtained from the questionnaire.</p>
  
  <h4>Relocate <b>Search Courses</b> button</h4>
  
  <p>Some users found the <b>Search Courses</b> button difficult to locate. A suggested fix was to move the
  button from the bottom of the courses pane to the top of the pane. This would make the button more
  visible and easier to find.</p>

  <div align="center"><i>Figure 1 Relocate Search Courses button</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h4>Remove export icon and replace with Export text button</h4>
  
  <p>Some users did not recognize the purpose of the export icon. This made it difficult for some users to complete
  the <b>Export to Google Calendar</b> task in a timely manner. A suggested fix was to replace the icon with an
  <b>Export</b> button as text.</p>
  
  <div align="center"><img src="images/suggestion2.png"></div>
  <div align="center"><i>Figure 2 Change export icon to a text button</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h4>Relocated Logout button from left side to right side of the application</h4>
  
  <p>The <b>Logout</b> button can be accidentally selected when tapping the <b>Courses</b> menu, which logs the user out of
  the application where they must log back in to complete a task. A suggested fix was to move the <b>Logout</b>
  button to the right side of the application next to the export button to prevent errors. Another suggested fix
  was to add a confirmation popup when a user selects the logout button.</p>

  <div align="center"><i>Figure 3 Relocated Logout button</i></div><br><br>
  
  <h4>Change blue Register in CSC 320 button to green</h4>
  
  <p>Some users did not recognize the <b>Register in CSC 320</b> as a button to add courses. Using this button allows a
  user to add courses faster. A suggested fix was to change the text of the button from blue to green in order to
  stand out from the other blue text in the courses screen.</p>

  <h3>Assumptions and Limitations</h3>
  
  <p>The participants of this usability study were not randomly selected students. Each participant was an
  acquaintance of Team DragonSquad. It was assumed that the participants would give honest feedback about the
  application.</p>
  
  <p>The study was limited to a small number of participants. Since the sample size was small, it is difficult to measure
  reliable statistics from the data.</p>
  
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  
  <p>Participants found the interface intuitive, easy to use, and learnable. It was found that the application improved
  on the time it takes to register for courses and was preferred over the Uvic MyPage interface. Useful feedback
  on how to improve the interface was obtained from the interviews. The usability study for the UvicSchedule
  application was considered a success, and all objectives were met.</p>
