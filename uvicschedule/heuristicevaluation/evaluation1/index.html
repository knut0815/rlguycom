  <h1>Heuristic Evaluation #1</h1>
  
  <h2>1. Application Description</h2>
  
  <p>UVicSchedule	application	is	being	evaluated	in	this	heuristic	evaluation.	The	
  application	is	used	to	organize	your	course	schedule.	You	are	able	to	add	and	drop	
  courses	on	your	schedule.	 Also,	you	can	share	your	schedule	with	your	friends	and	
  see	their	schedules	as	well.</p>
  
     
  <h2>2. Nielsen's heuristics and descriptions</h2>
  
  <ol>
    <li><b>	Visibility	of	system	status</b><br>
        The	system	should	always	keep	users	informed	about	what	is	going	on,	
        through	appropriate	feedback	within	reasonable	time.
    </li><br>
    <li><b>	Match	between	system	and	real	world	(Speak	the	user's language)	</b><br>
        Speak	the	users'	language,	with	words,	phrases	and	concepts	familiar	to	the	
        user.	Follow	real-world	conventions,	and	natural	/	logical	order.	
    </li><br>
    <li><b>User	control	and	freedom	(Clearly	marked	exits)	</b><br>
        Users	often	choose	system	functions	by	mistake	and	will	need	a	clearly
        marked and	quick	“emergency	exit”.	Support	undo	and	redo,	a	clear	way	to	
        navigate.
    </li><br>
    <li><b>Consistency	and	standards</b><br>
        Users	should	not	have	to	wonder	whether	different	words,	situations,	or	
        actions	mean	the	same	thing.	Follow platform	conventions.	
    </li><br>
    <li><b>Help	users	recognize,	diagnose,	recover	from	errors</b><br>
        Error	messages	should	be	expressed	in	plain	language,	precisely	indicate	the	
        problem,	and	suggest	a	solution.	
    </li><br>
    <li><b>Error	prevention</b><br>
        Even	better	than	good	error	messages	is	a	careful	design,	which	prevents	a	
        problem	from	occurring	in	the	first	place.
    </li><br>
    <li><b>	Recognition	rather	than	recall</b><br>
        Minimize	the	user's	memory	load.	Make	objects,	actions,	options,	and	
        instructions	visible.
    </li><br>
    <li><b>Flexibility	and	efficiency	of	use</b><br>
        Accelerators	— unseen	by	the	novice	— may	speed	up	interaction	for	the	
        expert. Allow	users	to	tailor	frequent	actions.
    </li><br>
    <li><b>Aesthetic	and	minimalist	design	</b><br>
        Dialogues	should	not	contain	information	that	is	irrelevant	or	rarely	needed.	
        Visual layout	principles:	contrast,	repetition,	alignment,	and	proximity.	
    </li><br>
    <li><b>Help	and documentation</b><br>
        Even	though	it	is	better	if	the	system	can	be	used	without	documentation,	it	
        may	be	necessary	to	provide	help	and documentation.	Any	such	information	
        should	be	easy	to	search,	focused	on the	user's	task,	list	concrete	steps	to	be	
        carried out,	and	not	be	too	large.
    </li><br>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>Nielsen's Scale:</h3>
  
  <p>
    0 =	I	don't	agree	that	this	is	a	usability	problem	at	all.<br>
    1 =	Cosmetic	problem	only:	need	not be	fixed	unless	extra	time	is available	on						
          project.<br>
    2 =	Minor	usability	problem:		fixing	this	should	be	given	low	priority.<br>
    3 =	Major	usability	problem:	important	to	fix,	so	should	be	given	high	priority.<br>
    4 =	Usability	catastrophe:	imperative	to	fix	this	before	product	can	be	released.
  </p>
  
  <h2>3. Findings</h2>
  
  <h3>3.1 [Recognition][Severity 3]</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      When	you	try	to	add	a	new	course,	you	cannot	see	the	
      schedule	clearly.	You	miss	some	days.
    </li>
    <li>
      This	is	a	major	usability	problem.	I	need	to	see	the	
      schedule	clearly	so	I	can	see	if	the	course	fits	my	
      schedule.
    </li>
    <li>
      When	the bar	on	the	left	appears,	the	size	of	the	
      schedule	should	get	smaller.	Therefore,	the	user	
      would	be	able	to	see	entire	schedule.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>3.2 [Recognition][Severity 2]</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      It	is	hard	to	see	the time bar
    </li>
    <li>
      This	is	a	minor	usability	problem.	It	doesn’t	affect the	
      user	but	if	someone	who	has	vision	problems	would	
      have	a	hard	time	to	recognize.
    </li>
    <li>
      The	time	bar	would	be	bigger	so	users	would	see	it	
      easily.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>3.3 [Recognition][Severity 2]</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Abbreviations	of	the	courses	are	not	clear.	Users	have	
      to know the abbreviations.
    </li>
    <li>
      This	is a	minor	usability	problem. When	you	click	on	
      the	courses,	in	the	description	it	is	not	shown	what	
      the	abbreviation	stands	for.
    </li>
    <li>
      In	the	description	the	full	name	of	the	course	should	
      be	written	so	the	user	would	know	what	the	
      abbreviation	stands	for.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>3.4	[Error prevention][Severity	3]</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Logout	button	wouldn't be	next	to	the	other	buttons	
      because	it	is	easy	to	hit	the	button	mistakenly	when	
      you	try	to	navigate	other	screens.	
    </li>
    <li>
      The	user	would	navigate	the	login	screen	so	he	has	to	
      login	again.	That	is	waste	of	time	so	this	is	a	major	
      usability	problem
    </li>
    <li>
      The	button	would	be	on	the	right	so	it	would	be	hard	
      to	make	a	mistake
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>4. Summary</h2>
  
  <p>Even	though	there	are	a	few	major	and	minor	usability	problems,
  the	application	is still usable and	efficient.	The	user	would	use	the	
  application	easily	and	wouldn’t	have	a	hard	time	to	figure	out	how	the	
  application	runs.	</p>
