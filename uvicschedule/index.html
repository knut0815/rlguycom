  <h1>UvicSchedule Software Prototype</h1>
  
  <p>This project is a software prototype for a mobile course scheduling 
  application. Features of the prototype include course timetable creation 
  and sharing course timetables with friends.</p>
  
  <p>This project was created for 
  a course in Human Computer Interaction in a team of three students. The project 
  involved iterative prototyping on paper and in software, and gathering feedback 
  from user testing and heuristic evaluations.</p>
  
  <p>The interactive software prototype was created in the 
  <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a> prototyping application and can 
  be viewed <a href="https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/WYYQJ9MQ">here</a>.</p>

  <h2>Design Process</h2><a name="designprocess"></a> 
  
  <h3>Paper Prototype</h3>
  
  <p>A conceptual model was created to map out the hypothetical functionality of
  the UVicSchedule application. Each team member individually created a paper prototype 
  based on the conceptual model. The best features of each paper prototype was then 
  merged into a single paper prototype.</p>

  <h3>Software Prototype</h3>
  
  <p>Each team member performed a cognitive walkthrough on the paper prototype 
  in order to find and correct flaws in the current design. The software prototype 
  was then created in the <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/">InVision</a> 
  prototyping application.</p>

  <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
  
  <p>The software prototype was handed over to three other students to evaluate the 
  usability of the application. The evaluation was based upon 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic_evaluation#Nielsen.27s_heuristics">
    Jakob Nielsen's Usability Heuristics.
  </a></p>

  <h3>Usability Study</h3>
  
  <p>An experiment was created and conducted on the target audient in order to 
  test the usability of the application and to gather feedback on how to improve 
  the layout and design.</p>
